# Forecasting-energy-consumption-using-machine-learning
In the forecasting energy consumption problem, we would be working withe energy consumption data and predicting the future consumption of energy for certain available electric grids in USA.

We would be performing data processing which is really important for machine learning and deep learning. The data is being enhanced by creating new features from the existing data for prediction.
